# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml


trigger:
  - master
pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"
container: gabrielcx/kicstest:v1.7.9.fix-debian
steps:
  # running in CI mode, exporting results to a JSON file and printing the results in stdout
  # KICS should fail the pipeline if results are found
  - script: |
      /app/bin/kics scan --ci -p ${PWD} -o ${PWD}
      cat results.json
